This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project integrates genomics-focused Large Language Models with advanced nanoparticle cancer therapy development. The core integration leverages the Awesome-LLMs-meet-genomes repository (https://github.com/ychuest/Awesome-LLMs-meet-genomes.git) to enhance the deep_nanoparticle_cancer_cure_plan.md strategy.

## LLM-Genomics Integration Strategy

### Key Applications from Awesome-LLMs-meet-genomes:

1. **Gene Pathogenicity Prediction Models**
   - Optimize CRISPR-Cas9 payload targeting (Phase III quantum targeting)
   - Identify high-impact genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells
   - Predict therapeutic efficacy based on patient genomic profiles

2. **DNA Sequence Design Tools**
   - Engineer genetic circuits for bacterial nanocarriers (Phase V biomimetic systems)
   - Design synthetic promoters for tumor-specific gene expression
   - Optimize viral vector sequences for nuclear delivery systems

3. **Variant Effect Prediction**
   - Predict cancer mutation impact on nanoparticle targeting effectiveness
   - Anticipate drug resistance mechanisms (Phase VI adaptive systems)
   - Personalize treatment based on individual mutation profiles

4. **Perturbation Analysis Models**
   - Predict cellular responses to multi-pathway targeting (Phase IV CSC eradication)
   - Model TME changes following nanoparticle intervention
   - Optimize sequential therapy timing and dosing

5. **Protein-Genomic Interaction Prediction**
   - Enhance protein corona engineering strategies (Phase I biological barriers)
   - Predict nanoparticle-protein binding affinities
   - Design molecularly imprinted surfaces for specific protein recognition

### Implementation Framework:

- **AlphaGenome Integration**: Regulatory variant prediction for biomarker-responsive release systems
- **Gene-LLM Application**: Real-time genomic analysis for adaptive treatment protocols
- **Function Prediction Models**: CSC pathway optimization and therapeutic target validation
- **Transformer-Based Genomics**: AI-guided treatment personalization and resistance prediction

### Development Priorities:

1. Integrate genomic LLMs into Phase VI AI-guided adaptive treatment systems
2. Apply DNA design models to Phase V biomimetic nanocarrier engineering
3. Leverage variant prediction for Phase IV cancer stem cell targeting optimization
4. Implement perturbation analysis for Phase II TME exploitation strategies

# Plan

Develop quantum-enhanced biomimetic nanoparticle systems that cure cancer through systems-level biological reprogramming, enhanced by genomics-focused AI models for personalized therapeutic adaptation.
