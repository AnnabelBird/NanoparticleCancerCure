# Nanoparticle Cancer Cure

This project aims to develop a comprehensive plan for curing cancer using advanced nanoparticle-based therapies. The core of this project is the integration of cutting-edge genomics-focused Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the design, delivery, and efficacy of these therapies.

## Glioblastoma Hard Use Case

This project includes a hard use case focusing on the application of these integrated technologies to treat glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer. The `glioblastoma_hard_use_case.md` file details a patient profile and a multi-phase treatment plan that leverages the AI-powered tools and nanoparticle strategies outlined in the core documents.

## Project Goal

The ultimate goal is to create a framework for developing personalized, adaptive, and highly effective cancer treatments by combining the power of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence.
